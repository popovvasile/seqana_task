### Seqana working student task solution

This is the solution for the Seqana working student challenge

I explored the dataset using different training models and compared their accuracy.

Here are the steps I took.

1) Data Visualisation
2) Selection of features with biggest correlation
3) Applying different models and their comparison

In order to run the code:

#### 1)Create a python virtual environment (for Linux virtualenv -p python3 venv)
#### 2)Activate it (source venv/bin/activate)
#### 3)pip install -r requirements.txt
#### 4)Run  jupyter notebook
